Yesod Websocket Chat Example
============================

Just worked through adding the chat example from yesod-websockets to a 
scaffolded yesod project.  I'm going to alter that code in my actual project, 
so thought I'd save it here.

There's also a purescript version, which is a bit crude-but-works.  If you cd 
into the purescript directory and 'grunt chat', it should build a 'templates/chat.julius' file.  

The commit history starts with an empty scaffolded project; you can step through the commits to see what changes where needed.

To try these examples out, do yesod devel on the project and navigate to

http:://localhost:3000/chat/js/

or

http:://localhost:3000/chat/ps/
